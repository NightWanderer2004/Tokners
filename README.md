# **Tokners** - landing page for a crypto company

### Link - [Tokners](https://my-tokners.netlify.app/)

### Description:

The page includes an authentication system, but it only works in development mode. When in production mode, I encountered issues with deploying the server part, so the page is only accessible without authentication.

### Plans for the future:

I want to rebuild this page using Next.js because I think it will be more convenient to work with. And finally, I will deploy the server part on Heroku.

### Site built with (MERN stack):

-  MongoDB;
-  Express;
-  React + Redux;
-  NodeJS;
